# cabin_for_spacetitanic_kaggle

This is my project imputing missing cabins in the dataset for kaggles 'space titanic' competition

After looking at the leaderboards and guides it seems like no one else has filled so many of these cabins accurately

Please refer to Final.ipynb for the Code I will be uploading to kaggle as an explanatory guide to filling them in, backed up with evidence for all my claims in the appendix



It starts with some preprocessing of the data useful for my algorithms and some results found by others which also assist before moving onto my methods
